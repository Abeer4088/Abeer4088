- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Abeer4088

Hello!
My name is Abeer Ahmed and Iâ€™m writing to all the coders in GitHub because I want to collaborate with you guys if one of you guys are open for business.
I would like an app with smart graphics and great mechanics like popular idle games like University Empire Tycoon or Coffee corp but it will be fast food franchise instead. I will show the video when the gamer wants to acquire more coins or increase customers and occasional ad can be considered as well.
I would like to monetise it with advertisements (admob) and In-app purchases.
Me and my marketing team would cover the marketing, sales, and finance.
Can you send me your previous references?
I would like to publish it on the app store first. The should have unity engine If you have any further questions, please let me know.
